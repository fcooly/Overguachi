## Overguachi

This is a basic data science project using data from players of [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/). The project is divided in two steps: scrapping the data using the [OW-API](https://ow-api.com/) and analyzing it with the help of [https://pandas.pydata.org/](https://pandas.pydata.org/). More info can be found in [this post](add.url.later).
